Brain cell finder
=================

Brain cell finder is a tool for fully automated localization of soma in 3D mouse brain images acquired by confocal light sheet microscopy. Parts of the method are detailed in [1] where bcfind was applied to the localization of Purkinje cells in a whole mouse cerebellum.


For documentation, please see the [bcfind page at DINFO, Università di Firenze](http://bcfind.dinfo.unifi.it "bcfind").



News
----

Release 1.1 includes several improvements. In particular:
- Cell detection is significantly faster
- Support of multiview images with a hierarchical registration pipeline and Multiview Semantic Deconvolution (MSD).

The method for multiview images is described in [2] Where it has been applied to the extraction of the activation map in a whole Arc-dVenus mouse brain.
